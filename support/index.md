## Restore Purchases (World Unlocks)
If you bought a World unlock and it's not showing up:

1. Open **Shufflescape**
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Tap **Restore Purchases**

Notes:

- Restores purchases made with the **same Apple ID**.
- If you're using TestFlight/Sandbox, make sure you're signed into the correct sandbox account on the device.

## Troubleshooting
- **No sound**: Check in-game Settings.
- **Game won't load / freezes**: Force quit the app and reopen.
- **Purchase button doesn't work**: Confirm you have internet access and try again.

- Device model (e.g. iPhone 15)
- iOS version
- App version + build number (from Settings app or in-game if shown)
